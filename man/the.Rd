\description{
\code{the} is an object that contains the fonts, colors, theme customizations
implemented by the ggchameleon package. \code{the} should not be edited directly,
and is updated automatically when one of the following is run:
\itemize{
\item \code{\link[=edit_the_main_palette]{edit_the_main_palette()}},
\item \code{\link[=edit_the_accent_palette]{edit_the_accent_palette()}},
\item \code{\link[=edit_the_fonts]{edit_the_fonts()}}
\item \code{\link[=edit_the_theme]{edit_the_theme()}}
}
}
\details{
\code{the} is named as such because it's intended to be used in the way that the
English word "the" is used. For example, if you would like the main color
used in your ggchameleon configurations, you can write
\code{the$main_palette$main}. This idea comes from  the suggestion
\href{https://r-pkgs.org/data.html#sec-data-state}{here}

\code{the} is useful if you need to reference the elements of your configurations
in other parts of your code. For example if you wanted to change the color of
a base R chart, you could get the color selections from \code{the}
}
\examples{
# Using Default base R colors
plot(cars)
# Using the current secondary color
plot(cars,col=the$main_palette$secondary)
# Editing the secondary color to pink
edit_the_main_palette(secondary="#FF00FF")
# New plot automatically updates `the` to pink
plot(cars,col=the$main_palette$secondary)
