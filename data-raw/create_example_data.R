# There are three published datasets from Drown, Liebl, and Anderson (2022)
# 1. Measurements
# 2. Responses to simulated predation
# 3. Amount of color change in the eyes of different animals
#
# These three are linkable by their internal ids. First, we'll save the raw data
# locally so that we can't lose it. Then we will extract the ids to create a
# crosswalk. Then we'll do some data cleaning to make the data more easily
# interpretable. Then we need to save the three data sets.
